# ベアメタルプログラミングでOS開発をする。

## ベアメタルプログラミングとは？
OSを介さずに直接ハードウェアにしか頼ることができない環境(ベアメタル環境)で行うプログラミング。

## バイナリを書いて実行してみる
1、バイナリを書く   
`img.hex` というファイルを作成し、下記のバイナリを書く。   
- `eb fe` : その命令自身に分岐する命令(要するに、無限ループ)。
- `55 aa` : コンピュータのファームウェア(BIOS)に、『このディスクが起動可能である』と伝える命令。
```
eb fe

55 aa
```

2、バイナリに変換する   
xxdコマンドを使って、`img.hex`をバイナリデータに変換する
```
$ xxd -r -p img.hex > img.bin
$ ls -lah img.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 ktaki8ra ktaki8ra 512 Aug 14 16:08 img.bin
```

3、QEMUを使って起動してみる
```
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=img.bin,format=raw
```
